/*  Question 3 : Write a Java program to check if  a number is a palindrome in Java?(121 is a palindrome, 321 is not)
A number is called a palindrome if the number is equal to the reverse of a number e.g., 121 is a palindrome because the reverse of 121 is 121 itself. On the otherr hand, 321 is not a palindrome because the reverse of 321 is 123, which is not equal to 321. */
